# Bank-Finance-System
This is currently my whole final project for our subject Computer Programming.

CURRENTLY USING NetBeans AS MY IDE, AND JFRAME CREATOR SINCE ITS WHAT OUR PROFESSOR TAUGHT US IN

This system will include numereous features that resemble a real functional banking system
it can save data with through linking it on my SQL Workbench. It acts normal and can perform
deposits, withdrawal, investing, and transaction history.

NOTE: Please do understand that I am still a first year student in the BSIT course in the
  Philippines, I do want to hear from other programmers about my project and what I can do to
  improve my current Project. Thank you for reading this, have a great day!

**THIS SYSTEM IS CURRENTLY STILL IN PROGRESS AND I'M WORKING TO MAKE IT WORK THE WAY I WANT IT TOO**
